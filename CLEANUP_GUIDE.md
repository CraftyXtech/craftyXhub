# Cleanup Guide - Deprecated Files

## Files to Delete

The following files are no longer used after the AI Editor improvements and can be safely deleted:

### Deprecated Editor Components

```bash
# Navigate to the admin frontend
cd /home/wetende/Projects/craftyxhub/frontend/admin

# Delete deprecated editor files
rm src/pages/ai-writer/AiEditorNew.jsx
rm src/pages/ai-writer/AiEditorEdit.jsx
rm src/pages/ai-writer/AiEditorGenerate.jsx
```

## Reason for Deprecation

These three files have been consolidated into a single unified component:
- **`AiEditorNew.jsx`** - Was just a wrapper calling AiEditorGenerate
- **`AiEditorEdit.jsx`** - Was just a wrapper calling AiEditorGenerate
- **`AiEditorGenerate.jsx`** - Logic moved to new AiEditor.jsx

## Replacement

All functionality is now handled by:
- âœ… **`AiEditor.jsx`** - Single component with mode detection

## Verification Before Deletion

Before deleting, verify the new component is working:

1. **Test New Document:**
   - Navigate to `/ai-writer/editor/new`
   - Should open blank editor
   - Create and save document

2. **Test Edit Document:**
   - Click edit on existing document
   - Should open at `/ai-writer/editor/{id}`
   - Should load document content

3. **Test Template Selection:**
   - Click template from templates page
   - Should navigate with template pre-selected

If all tests pass, the old files can be safely deleted.

## Build Verification

After deletion, run:
```bash
cd frontend/admin
npm run build
```

Should complete without errors.

## Optional: Cleanup Documentation Files

Once you've reviewed the documentation, you may want to move these to a docs folder:

```bash
# Create docs folder
mkdir -p docs/improvements

# Move documentation
mv AI_DASHBOARD_IMPROVEMENTS.md docs/improvements/
mv ICON_VISIBILITY_FIX.md docs/improvements/
mv DASHBOARD_OVERVIEW_IMPROVEMENTS.md docs/improvements/
mv AI_EDITOR_IMPROVEMENTS.md docs/improvements/
mv COMPLETE_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md docs/improvements/
mv CLEANUP_GUIDE.md docs/improvements/

# Or delete if not needed
rm AI_DASHBOARD_IMPROVEMENTS.md
rm ICON_VISIBILITY_FIX.md
rm DASHBOARD_OVERVIEW_IMPROVEMENTS.md
rm AI_EDITOR_IMPROVEMENTS.md
rm COMPLETE_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md
rm CLEANUP_GUIDE.md
```

---

**Note:** Do not delete the old files until you've thoroughly tested the new unified editor component in both new and edit modes.
