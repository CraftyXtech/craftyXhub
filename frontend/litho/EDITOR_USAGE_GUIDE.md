## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### "I type but nothing appears"
- **Issue**: You started with "/"
- **Fix**: Close the menu (press Esc) and start typing normally

### "The menu keeps opening"
- **Issue**: You're typing "/" at the start of a block
- **Fix**: Type "/" only when you want to insert a special block type

### "I can't see my text"
- **Issue**: Check browser zoom or CSS conflicts
- **Fix**: Try Ctrl+0 to reset zoom
