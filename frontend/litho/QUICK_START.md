## 🎯 **What Was Wrong Before**

### ❌ The Mistake:
```
1. User types "/" first
2. Menu opens
3. All typing goes into the search field
4. No text appears in the editor
```

### ✅ The Correct Way:
```
1. Click in the editor
2. Type normally (no "/" yet)
3. Text appears!
4. Use "/" only when you want special blocks
```

## 🐛 **If You Still Don't See Text**

### Check These:

1. **Browser Zoom**
   - Press `Ctrl+0` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+0` (Mac)
   - This resets zoom to 100%

2. **Text Color**
   - Open browser developer tools (F12)
   - Inspect the text area
   - Check if color is set to white on white

3. **JavaScript Errors**
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Look for red errors
   - Share them if you see any

4. **Clear Cache**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` to hard refresh
   - This clears cached CSS/JS

## 💡 **Remember**

- **"/"** = Open block menu (only use when you want special blocks)
- **Normal typing** = Just type, it will appear!
- **Enter** = New paragraph
- **Select text** = Format it (bold, italic, etc.)
