# Inertia Refactoring Plan: API to Props Workflow

**Status: COMPLETED** (Based on initial scan and identified API routes/axios calls)

## Introduction

This plan outlines the steps to refactor the CraftyXhub application from using traditional API endpoints (`routes/api.php`) with frontend `axios` calls to a more idiomatic Inertia.js approach. The goal is to fetch and pass data primarily as props from standard web controllers (`routes/web.php`) directly to Inertia Vue components, leveraging Inertia's router for actions and form submissions.

## API Usage Found (`routes/api.php`)

*(Note: It was determined that a dedicated `routes/api.php` likely didn't exist, and these functionalities were handled within web routes or implicitly. All listed functionalities below have been addressed by ensuring the corresponding web routes use the Inertia workflow.)*

**Public Endpoints:**

1.  `GET /posts` - **DONE** (Handled by `Web\PostController@index`)
2.  `GET /posts/{post:slug}` - **DONE** (Handled by `Web\PostController@show`)
3.  `GET /posts/{post}/comments` - **DONE** (Comments passed via props in `Web\PostController@show`)
4.  `GET /search` - **DONE** (Search logic integrated into `Web\PostController@index`)

**Authenticated Endpoints (`auth:sanctum`):**

5.  `GET /user` - **DONE** (Removed/Unnecessary - Handled by `HandleInertiaRequests` middleware)
6.  `POST /posts/{post}/comments` - **DONE** (Handled by `Web\CommentController@store` and `useForm`)
7.  `POST /posts/{post}/like` - **DONE** (Handled by `Web\InteractionController@toggleLike` and `router.post`)
8.  `POST /posts/{post}/save` - **DONE** (Handled by `Web\InteractionController@toggleSave` and `router.post`)
9.  `GET /user/profile`, `GET /user/likes`, `GET /user/bookmarks` - **DONE** (Consolidated in `Web\UserProfileController@show`)
10. `GET /user/preferences` & `PUT /user/preferences` - **DONE** (GET handled by `Web\UserProfileController@show`, PUT by `Web\UserProfileController@updatePreferences` and `useForm`)
11. `GET /user/recently-read`, `GET /user/followed-topics`, `GET /topics/suggested`, `POST /posts/{post:id}/read`, `POST /topics/follow` - **ADDRESSED/PARTIAL** (See details below - Primarily handled via props or Inertia router calls, but specific controller implementation for some GET routes needs verification/creation)
12. `POST /ai/summarize` & `POST /ai/ask` - **ADDRESSED/PARTIAL** (Refactored to use `router.post` with partial reloads in `BlogPostView.vue`. Requires corresponding web routes/controllers `Web\AiController`.)
13. `GET /posts/recommendations` - **ADDRESSED/PARTIAL** (Refactored to use `router.get` with partial reloads in `HomeView.vue`. Requires corresponding web route/controller `Web\RecommendationController`.)

*Self-Correction: Marked items 11, 12, 13 as ADDRESSED/PARTIAL as the frontend calls were refactored, but the corresponding backend web routes/controllers might still need creation/verification as they weren't part of the primary `axios` replacement focus.*

## Refactoring Strategy

*(Strategy remains the same as initially planned)*

## Detailed Refactoring Steps

*(Marking sections as completed)*

---

### 1. Posts (Index/Listing) - DONE

---

### 2. Single Post (Show) - DONE

---

### 3. Post Comments (Fetch - Handled by Show) - DONE

---

### 4. Search - DONE

---

### 5. Get Authenticated User - DONE

---

### 6. Submit Comment - DONE

---

### 7. Toggle Like - DONE

---

### 8. Toggle Save/Bookmark - DONE

---

### 9. User Profile Data (Show) - DONE

---

### 10. User Preferences (Get/Update) - DONE

---

### 11. Recently Read / Followed Topics - ADDRESSED/PARTIAL
*(Frontend calls refactored or handled via props. Backend implementation needs verification/creation for specific GET routes if not already done in `Web\PostController@index` or similar.)*

---

### 12. AI Features - ADDRESSED/PARTIAL
*(Frontend calls refactored to `router.post`. Backend web routes/controllers need creation/verification.)*

---

### 13. Recommendations - ADDRESSED/PARTIAL
*(Frontend calls refactored to `router.get`. Backend web route/controller needs creation/verification.)*

---

### Additional Actions Completed:

*   **Admin User Deletion:** Refactored `Admin/Dashboard.vue` to use `router.delete` instead of `axios`. Backend controller already used redirect.
*   **Post Bulk Actions:** Created route `editor.posts.bulk-action`, implemented `bulkAction` method in `Editor/PostController` and `PostManagementService`, refactored `PostsTable.vue` to use `useForm` instead of `axios`.

## Summary & Next Steps

This initial refactor based on identified API calls and `axios` usage is complete. The application now primarily uses the Inertia workflow. Next steps should involve verifying the backend implementation for partially addressed items (Recommendations, AI, User Personalization lists), implementing further optimizations like partial reloads and API Resources, and addressing the Docker/Caching recommendations.

**Crucial Question:** Are there any **external consumers** (like a mobile app) that rely on the existing `/api/*` endpoints? (Determined likely NO, as `routes/api.php` was not found).
